// LinearSearchSorted - search in increasing sorted list
// when you encounter a greater value element from the increasing sorted list, you stop searching further.
// Time Complexity: O(n). As we need to traverse the complete list in worst case.
// Worst case is when your desired element is at the last position of the sorted list. However, in the average case this algorithm is more efficient even though the growth rate is same as unsorted.
// Space Complexity: O(1). No extra memory is used to allocate the list.
